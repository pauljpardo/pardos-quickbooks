### Project name
 
Pardo's Quickbooks


### Project Description

Pardo's Quickbooks is based on a budgeting app. One you can use to keep track of all your monthtly subscriptions and see where you are overspending. My inspiration behind this app comes from being in a coding bootcamp and need to make sure I can budget correctly to get through the couple of months without income.
